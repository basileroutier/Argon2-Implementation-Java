# Argon2 Implementation In Java
Argon2 is a library allowing to hash passwords in a robust way.
The proposed implementation is used with Castle for Spring (but can be used in Java if needed) to use Argon2.

# Why use Argon2 ?
Argon2 is modern ASIC-resistant and GPU-resistant secure key derivation function. It has better password cracking resistance (when configured correctly) than PBKDF2, Bcrypt and Scrypt (for similar configuration parameters for CPU and RAM usage).
